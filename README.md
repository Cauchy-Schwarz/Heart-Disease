Heart Disease Fatality Prediction Model
• Needed to predict fatalities from heart-related problems using patients' health data, utilizing R and several libraries along R Studio.
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using box plots and hierarchical clustering. Generated several models, assessed their performance using confusion matrices for type I and II errors, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Utilized Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and K-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.
• Result was a logistic model with 78% accuracy in predicting heart-related fatalities by using complex health data, statistical methods, and selecting high-performing models.
